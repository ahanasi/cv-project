# CV Application

This project was created as part of the [Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application).

A small CV application created to explore the concepts of States and Props in class components. The application is structured into four sections: General Information, Work Experience, Education and Skills. Each section includes an edit and submit button, and the CV as a whole includes the option to toggle to read-only view and print.
